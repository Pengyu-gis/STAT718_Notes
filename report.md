# Spatial Analysis of Fatal Road Accidents Using Poisson Point Process Modeling

## 1. Modeling Framework: Poisson Point Process

In this study, we model the occurrence of fatal road traffic accidents as a **spatial Poisson point process**. This approach treats the observed fatalities as realizations of a stochastic process occurring over a continuous spatial domain (in our case, the road network of South Carolina).

The **log-likelihood** of a nonhomogeneous Poisson point process is given by:

\[
\log L(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log \lambda(x_i) - \int_W \lambda(x) \, dx
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda(x) \): The **intensity function**, representing the expected number of fatal events per unit area (or road length) at location \( x \)
- \( x_i \): Coordinates of observed fatal accidents
- \( W \): The spatial domain (the road network)

Since the integral \( \int_W \lambda(x) dx \) is typically intractable in real-world applications, we approximate it using **Monte Carlo integration** over a set of background (non-fatal) points:

\[
\int_W \lambda(x) dx \approx \sum_{j=1}^m w_j \cdot \lambda(x_j)
\]

Where:
- \( x_j \): Sampled background locations
- \( w_j \): Weights that represent the area or road segment each background point stands for
- \( m \): Total number of background (non-event) points

This transforms the full likelihood into a form that is implementable via **weighted Poisson regression**.

## 2. The Meaning of Weights

In our point process modeling, the **weights** serve to approximate the integral term in the likelihood using a discrete set of non-event (background) points.

- For **fatalities**, we assign:
  \[
  w_i = 1
  \]
  These are the observed events, directly contributing to the numerator of the log-likelihood.

- For **background points**, we assign:
  \[
  w_j = \frac{A}{m}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( A \): Total length of roads (in 100-meter units)
  - \( m \): Number of background points sampled

This weighting ensures that the background points collectively approximate the spatial opportunity for a fatal crash to occur. It is not a sampling weight in the survey sense, but a **numerical approximation of integration**.

Our background points are **non-fatal crash locations** drawn from the same traffic accident dataset, which assumes that the exposure to fatality is proportional to exposure to any crash. Hence, the model estimates the **fatality intensity conditional on crash occurrence**.

## 3. Correlation and Dependence Between Predictors

We evaluated potential multicollinearity among the continuous predictors: **Slope**, **Curvature**, and **AADT (Average Annual Daily Traffic)**.

### ðŸ”¹ Pearson Correlation Matrix

|              | Slope    | Curvature | AADT     |
|--------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Slope**    | 1.000000 | -0.107572 | -0.166621 |
| **Curvature**| -0.107572| 1.000000  | 0.044780 |
| **AADT**     | -0.166621| 0.044780  | 1.000000 |

All pairwise correlations are weak (absolute values < 0.2), indicating negligible linear dependence between variables.

### ðŸ”¹ Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

| Variable   | VIF      |
|------------|----------|
| const      | 8.647327 |
| Slope      | 1.042054 |
| Curvature  | 1.013978 |
| Night      | 1.009383 |
| Surface    | 1.003594 |
| Workzone   | 1.004390 |
| AADT       | 1.037288 |

All VIFs are close to 1.0, well below the standard threshold of 5 or 10 for concern. This confirms that **multicollinearity is not present** in the dataset.

Thus, the parameter estimates from the Poisson point process model can be interpreted reliably without the confounding effects of correlated predictors.

## 4. Covariate Diagnostics via Sliding Window Regression (All Roads)

To investigate whether the effects of continuous covariates remain stable across their ranges, we conducted a **sliding window Poisson regression** for:

- **AADT** (Average Annual Daily Traffic)
- **Curvature**
- **Slope**

Each diagnostic follows these steps:
1. The dataset is sorted by the covariate of interest
2. A fixed-size window (e.g., 200,000 points) is slid along this ordered list
3. A separate Poisson regression is fitted in each window
4. We record the coefficient estimate for the covariate of interest
5. We apply LOESS smoothing and construct a 95% confidence ribbon to visualize local trends

### ðŸ”¹ AADT: Effect Weakens at Higher Traffic Volume

![AADT Sliding Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b51078b7-280f-44b8-b124-fe228ddb4cd5)

> The AADT coefficient is consistently negative, indicating that roads with higher traffic volumes are **less likely to experience fatal crashes**. However, the **magnitude of this negative effect weakens** as traffic increases, suggesting **diminishing returns** to safety benefits from volume alone.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Curvature: Consistent Mild Risk

![Curvature Sliding Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bce62c27-3d89-45f1-a579-92d157a4a5e4)

> The curvature coefficient remains negative across all windows, suggesting that **more sharply curved roads are associated with higher fatality risk**. However, the effect size is small, and the confidence intervals include values near zero.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Slope: Increasingly Positive Association

![Slope Sliding Window](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a79f1f6-6878-47f5-b5e0-84bbfece715d)

> The slope effect varies notably across the gradient. It is **negative for lower slopes** (suggesting gentle slopes are not associated with risk), but **becomes positive at higher slopes**, indicating **elevated fatality risk in steep terrain**.

## 5. Spatial Distribution of Estimated Fatal Crash Intensity \( \hat{\lambda}(x) \)

The final output of our Poisson point process model is the estimated intensity surface \( \hat{\lambda}(x) \) across the entire South Carolina road network.

![Î»Ì‚(x) All Roads](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d28ed3-d2a4-411f-b625-7abe51318bc2)

> Areas of high intensity (brighter values) correspond to major intersections, dense urban corridors, and highly sloped or curved roads with low AADT â€” reflecting model-predicted regions of elevated fatal crash likelihood.

---
## 6. GLM Results: Poisson Point Process on All Roads

We fitted a weighted Poisson regression model to estimate the intensity of fatal crashes using all roads and 400,000 quadrature points. The table below summarizes the estimated coefficients:

| Variable      | Coefficient | Std. Error | z-value | p-value |
|---------------|-------------|------------|---------|---------|
| Intercept     | -0.7368     | 0.046      | -15.88  | <0.001  |
| Slope         | 0.0192      | 0.008      | 2.43    | 0.015   |
| Curvature     | -1.16e-05   | 8.38e-06   | -1.38   | 0.167   |
| Night         | 0.5429      | 0.032      | 17.12   | <0.001  |
| Surface       | -0.0553     | 0.043      | -1.29   | 0.198   |
| Workzone      | -0.1474     | 0.131      | -1.12   | 0.262   |
| AADT          | -1.51e-05   | 1.43e-06   | -10.54  | <0.001  |


---

### Interpretation

- **AADT**: The negative and highly significant coefficient indicates that roads with higher average daily traffic volumes are associated with **lower fatality intensity**.
- **Slope**: The positive and significant coefficient suggests an **increased risk on steeper roads**, which aligns with the sliding window result.
- **Night**: A strong positive effect confirms that fatalities are **more likely to occur at night**.
- **Curvature, Surface, and Workzone**: These predictors show non-significant effects in the global model. However, **local effects** may still be present, as shown by the sliding window diagnostics.

---

Overall, the model identifies **traffic volume, slope, and nighttime conditions** as key contributors to fatal crash intensity across South Carolina's road network.

## 7. Road-Type-Specific Modeling: Highways vs. Local Roads

To evaluate differences in fatal crash dynamics between road types, we ran two separate weighted Poisson regression models:

- One for **Highways and Interstates**
- One for **Local Roads**

Both models use the same covariates and methodology as the full-road model, but segment the data based on road classification.

### ðŸ”¹ Spatial Distribution of Î»Ì‚(x): Highway vs. Local Roads

![[Î»Ì‚(x) by Road Type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bcf1167-7f57-4b0c-8290-1a8f921bf2fd)

> The intensity of fatal crashes \( \hat{\lambda}(x) \) is highest on **highway junctions and corridors**. In contrast, local roads exhibit **spatially dispersed intensity**, often centered around urbanized clusters and curved segments.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Sliding Window Analysis of AADT Coefficient

To explore whether the effect of AADT varies across its distribution, we conducted sliding window GLMs separately by road class.

![AADT Coefficients by Road Type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca0b406-cb1a-4716-ba60-0fac8fd88b08)


- **Highways** (Top): AADT coefficient remains consistently negative and close to zero, with narrow CI bands  
- **Local Roads** (Bottom): AADT effect fluctuates more and shows stronger negative associations for lower AADT windows

> This contrast suggests that **AADT plays a more substantial role in fatal crash suppression on local roads**, where increases in traffic volume may lead to lower speeds and improved visibility.

---

### Interpretation

- The **Night** variable remains the strongest and most stable risk factor across all road types.
- On **Highways**, the effect of slope is only marginally significant, and curvature shows no impact.
- On **Local Roads**, **Curvature becomes statistically significant**, suggesting design geometry contributes more substantially to local-level fatality risk.

This road-type comparison underscores the value of disaggregated spatial modeling in transportation safety analytics.
